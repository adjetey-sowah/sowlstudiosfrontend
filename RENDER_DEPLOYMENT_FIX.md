# Fix for Render Deployment MIME Type Error

## Problem
You're getting this error when deploying to Render:
```
Loading module from "https://sowlstudiosfrontend.onrender.com/src/main.tsx" was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type ("binary/octet-stream").
```

## Root Cause
The issue occurs because:
1. Your app was deployed as a **web service** instead of a **static site**
2. The production build wasn't properly configured
3. Render was trying to serve source files instead of built files

## Solution Applied

### 1. Changed Deployment Type
**Before:** `type: web` (Node.js server)
**After:** `type: static_site` (Static file hosting)

### 2. Updated Build Configuration
```yaml
# render.yaml
services:
  - type: static_site
    name: sowl-studios-frontend
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    routes:
      - type: rewrite
        source: /*
        destination: /index.html
```

### 3. Added SPA Routing Support
- Created `public/_redirects` file for client-side routing
- Added route rewriting in `render.yaml`

### 4. Fixed Environment Variables
- Updated API URLs to use your actual backend
- Corrected contact information
- Set proper production flags

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Commit and push** your changes to GitHub
2. **Go to Render Dashboard**
3. **Delete the existing service** (if it exists)
4. **Create a new Static Site**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
   - Click "Create Static Site"

### Option 2: Manual Configuration
If you prefer manual setup:

1. **Create New Static Site** in Render
2. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo
3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://sowlstudios.onrender.com/api/v1
   VITE_ACTUATOR_BASE_URL=https://sowlstudios.onrender.com/actuator
   VITE_NODE_ENV=production
   ```
5. **Deploy**

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

### 1. Check Build Logs
Look for successful build completion:
```
âœ“ built in 45.67s
âœ“ 15 modules transformed.
dist/index.html                   0.45 kB
dist/assets/index-a1b2c3d4.js    145.67 kB
```

### 2. Test Website
- Visit your Render URL
- Check that the site loads properly
- Test navigation (should work without page refreshes)
- Verify admin dashboard access at `/admin`

### 3. Check Network Tab
- Open browser DevTools â†’ Network
- Refresh the page
- Verify files are served with correct MIME types:
  - `.js` files: `application/javascript`
  - `.css` files: `text/css`
  - `.html` files: `text/html`

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: 404 on Page Refresh
**Cause**: SPA routing not configured
**Solution**: Ensure `_redirects` file exists and route rewriting is configured

### Issue 2: Environment Variables Not Working
**Cause**: Variables not prefixed with `VITE_`
**Solution**: All frontend env vars must start with `VITE_`

### Issue 3: Build Fails
**Cause**: Missing dependencies or build errors
**Solution**: 
- Check build logs in Render
- Test build locally: `npm run build`
- Fix any TypeScript/ESLint errors

### Issue 4: Assets Not Loading
**Cause**: Incorrect base path or asset references
**Solution**: Ensure all assets are in `public/` folder and referenced correctly

## Local Testing

Before deploying, test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to test the production build locally.

## File Structure After Fix

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _redirects          # SPA routing support
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vite.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                   # Generated after build
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _redirects
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.production         # Production environment variables
â”œâ”€â”€ render.yaml             # Render configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ vite.config.ts
```

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

âœ… **Static Site Deployment**: Proper static file hosting
âœ… **Correct MIME Types**: JavaScript files served as `application/javascript`
âœ… **SPA Routing**: Client-side routing works correctly
âœ… **Environment Variables**: Production configuration applied
âœ… **Fast Loading**: Optimized build with code splitting
âœ… **Admin Dashboard**: Accessible at `/admin`

## Monitoring

After deployment:
- Monitor build times (should be 2-5 minutes)
- Check site performance with Lighthouse
- Verify all features work in production
- Test admin dashboard functionality

Your Sowl Studios website should now deploy successfully to Render without MIME type errors! ðŸŽ‰
